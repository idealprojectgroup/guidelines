[Sandi Metz’ rules for developers](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/50655960596/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)
- Classes can be no longer than one hundred lines of code.
- Methods can be no longer than five lines of code.
- Pass no more than four parameters into a method. Hash options are parameters.
- Controllers can instantiate only one object. Therefore, views can only know about one instance variable and views should only send messages to that object `@object.collaborator.value` is not allowed).

[How to be a great software
developer](http://peternixey.com/post/83510597580/how-to-be-a-great-software-developer)
- "Your value as a developer is measured not in the height of your peaks, but the area under your line"
- "Go deep before you go wide - learn your chosen stack inside out"
- "Learn to detect the smell of bad code"
- "Check and re-check your code. Your problems are yours to fix"
- "Write up the things you’ve done and share them with the team"
- "Understand and appreciate the exquisite balance between too much testing and too little"
- "Make your team better"
- "Your contribution as a developer is defined not by the abstraction of how smart you are or how much you know. It’s not defined by the technology acronyms on your resume, the companies you’ve worked at or which college you went to. They hint at what you’re capable of but who you are is defined by what you do and how that changes the project and the people around you."
