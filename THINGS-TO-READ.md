- Classes can be no longer than one hundred lines of code.
- Methods can be no longer than five lines of code.
- Pass no more than four parameters into a method. Hash options are parameters.

- In response to this article: [What I Wish I Knew When I Started My Career as a Software Developer](http://lifehacker.com/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started-my-career-as-a-softwa-1681002791)
- "timeframes that seem absurdly bloated beforehand tend to look reasonable, even respectable, at the end of a project"
- "projects fail far more often because the software never really works reliably than because they missed a tight market window"
- "with all the details and pitfalls and tangents in plain sight, you can see that that the initial estimate was hopelessly unrealistic"

[How to be a great software
developer](http://peternixey.com/post/83510597580/how-to-be-a-great-software-developer)
- "Your value as a developer is measured not in the height of your peaks, but the area under your line"
- "Go deep before you go wide - learn your chosen stack inside out"
- "Learn to detect the smell of bad code"
- "Check and re-check your code. Your problems are yours to fix"
- "Write up the things you’ve done and share them with the team"
- "Understand and appreciate the exquisite balance between too much testing and too little"
- "Make your team better"
- "Your contribution as a developer is defined not by the abstraction of how smart you are or how much you know. It’s not defined by the technology acronyms on your resume, the companies you’ve worked at or which college you went to. They hint at what you’re capable of but who you are is defined by what you do and how that changes the project and the people around you."
