Standards
=========

My hope is this will become a living general standards document for Ideal
Project Group. At this point, this is simply a brain dump whenever I think of something. Feel free to add to this.

## HTML
- Indentation.

## CSS
- Use classes only for styling (rarely for JavaScript).
- Use ids when you need to reference something for JavaScript.
- Bonus Points: Use data-attributes when you need to reference something for JavaScript.

## Ruby

## Git
- Commit subject lines should not exceed 50 characters.
- Label broken or otherwise incomplete commits with WIP followed by a description.
